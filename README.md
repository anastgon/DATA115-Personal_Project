# DATA115-Personal_Project

### Motivation 

As someone who comes from the Equestrian sport, I was interested in finding the sports statistics. For the following project I decided to find out who is the TOP riders in Olympian games and if the age has correlation on their rank number. I think that this would be an interesting question because majority of the top riders are individuals who in middle and older adult life stages.


### Data Sources

To find my data, I typed in Google search “top equesterian riders” and after looking through different sites, I chose TopEndSports cite (https://www.topendsports.com). The site took me to the link where i found the table “The Top Ranked Athletes from Equestrian at the Olympic Games.” I downloaded the data and uploaded it into Excel. Unfortunately, it did not have information about the age of the riders and if or not they are retired and alive. I did my research on each rider and found the year (from which I have subtracted the birth year to get the exact age) when they had retired or found how old are they if they are still riding. I also have included the information if the rider retired or not. After all the research, my data had everything that I needed to start analyzing it. 
(notes: the ranking might change overtime)

### Visualization

For my visualization, I have chosen to make a scatterplot comparing the Age and the Rank of the best riders. Doing so I will try to see if there are any clusters, patterns, correlations, or linear regressions. I have the Rank of the Y-axis and Age on the X-axis showing the respective data. I have labeled points by rider's name and have collected them based on their gender.

### Analysis

I wanted to found out if the age of the riders correlates to their current rank. For that, I have made a scatterplot comparing their rank to the age they have stopped competing. Analyzing this graph I have noticed that there is some clustering in the first 6 ranks with riders' age being between the early 40s to early 50s. Furthermore, lower ranks being in their late 30s and having an outlier (Andrew Hoy). Further research would be needed with a larger dataset of the riders to see if the same pathers occur.
