# DATA115-Personal_Project

### Motivation 
As someone who comes from the Equestrian sport, I was interested in finding the sports statistics. For the following project I decided to find out who is the TOP riders in Olympian games and if the age has correlation on their rank number. I think that this would be an interesting question because majority of the top riders are individuals who in middle and older adult life stages.


### Data Sources
To find my data, I typed in Google search “top equesterian riders” and after looking through different sites, I chose TopEndSports cite (https://www.topendsports.com). The site took me to the link where i found the table “The Top Ranked Athletes from Equestrian at the Olympic Games.” I downloaded the data and uploaded it into Excel. Unfortunately, it did not have information about the age of the riders and if or not they are retired and alive. I did my research on each rider and found the year (from which I have subtracted the birth year to get the exact age) when they had retired or found how old are they if they are still riding. I also have included the information if the rider retired or not. After all the research, my data had everything that I needed to start analyzing it. 
(notes: the ranking might change overtime)

### Analysis
I wanted to found out if the age of the riders correlates to their current rank.
